# apollo-federation-demo
Work to try to make graphql dynamic without restarting gateway

Make sure to run npm i

FYI:
Put the serviceList.txt in a remote place outside the project and reference its path in index.js

(Also ignore book-api.js, hello-world.js and the html file. I was just practicing with other stuff before I got to my solution. XD )
